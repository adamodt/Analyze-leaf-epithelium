### FDV_cell_database

This folder contains .tif image files for stained epidermides sampled from various species. 
The species and sample names may be cross-refereced using the 'global_database.csv' included in this submission.

There are two different formats for naming the microscope images. 

1. The first convention has a number of numeric fields separated by hyphens; 
fields 1 and 2 combined determine the species (please see 'global_database.csv' file); 
Field 3 contains the magnification of the field; 
Field 4 denotes the side of the leaf represented in the picture (i.e. adaxial or abaxial; please see 'global_database.csv' as 1 and 2 are not consistent in `leaf_orientation`); 
Field 5 is an arbitrary numbering of the images from a leaf side.

In some cases an optional text appendage 'overview' explains that the image is an overview, rather than the image from which measurements were taken. 

When orientation leaf is not set, it is unknown.

### FDV_leaf_database

There are two different formats for naming leaf images
The first convention has a number of numeric fields separated by periods.
Fields 1 and 2 combined determine the species (please see 'global_database.csv' file in 'leaf_id')
Field 3 is the species name
